# <img src="/images/logo.svg" style="display:inline;width:32px;height:32px" /> SVGcut

<em>SVGcut is a fork of [`jscut`](https://github.com/tbfleming/jscut).
Development of `jscut` was abandoned in 2014, when the author moved on to other things.</em>

SVGcut is a simple Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) application that
runs in the browser. It takes SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files as
inputs, and generates Gcode under interactive control. You can then
save the Gcode for sending to your CNC machine using an application
such as [Candle](https://github.com/Denvi/Candle). It is primarily
aimed at hobbyist milling machines (routers), and doesn't support many
of the capabilities of more sophisticated machines, such as tool
swapping.

No need to install anything, you can
[run it in your browser](https://cdot.github.io/SVGcut/app.html).

SVGcut is tested with Firefox 134.0.0, Inkscape 1.4, Candle2, and a
SainSmart Genmitsu 3018-PRO Router. If you want to contribute to
development, see [DEVELOPING](DEVELOPING.md).

## Preparing your SVG

To prepare your SVG, make sure you draw you it at the size that you want your
final work to be. If you are using Inkscape, then set your units to
whatever physical measure you feel most comfortable with (usually
millimetres or inches) and simply draw at that scale. It is easiest,
though not essential, to set your page size to the area that your CNC
machine can handle. Make sure that the Scale (in Document Properties)
is set to 1.

There are some limitations:
- You may have to use the "Path->Object to Path" command to convert some objects (such as text) into paths.
- Colour can be confusing. Beware of creating paths the same colour as their background, or that are covered by other objects.
- Stroke width is also ignored, so you are recommended to set a very small stroke width.

*Tip* If you have a drawing that makes heavy use of complex features
(such as text) you might consider taking a copy and preparing it for
machining, rather than converting your original to paths and losing
all the nice features.

## Tool

The next step is to set the parameters of the tool you are
using. Click on the `Tool Settings` button to open the settings
pane. There is popup help on each of the options.

## Material

Open the material pane to specify the material you are working
with. There is popup help on each of the options.

## Import SVG

Open the `File` menu and select `Import SVG` to load your SVG
file. If you have more than one SVG file you can load them all at
once, or one after another. You should be able to see your SVG in the `Toolpaths` tab. You can zoom (mouse wheel) and pan.

## Operations

Use the mouse to select the paths (the _geometry_) you want to convert
to Gcode (click a path again to deselect it; a double-click will
select all paths). They will change colour. In the `Operations` pane,
click `Create Operation` to tell it what you want to do with the
selected paths. There are a number of operations available:
+ `Engrave` - the tool will follow the paths (basically what a pen plotter does).
+ `Outside` - will cut around the outside of the paths.
+ `Inside` - will cut around the inside of your paths.
+ `Pocket (concentric)` - will carve out the interior of your selected paths using ever-decreasing circles.
+ `Pocket (raster)` - will carve out the interior of your selected paths using side-to-side tool movements.
+ `Perforate` - will drill a series of evenly-spaced holes outside the boundary of closed paths, or along the line of open paths. You can control the spacing of the holes.

The `Toolpaths` pane will change to show what has been selected for
the operation, and the tool paths generated for that operation.

Now you should set the depth to which you want your selected operation
to cut (it won't necessarily cut to this depth immediately, it may do
several passes in steps of the `Pass Depth` you set in the `Tool
Settings` pane). There are other options that can be set in the
drop-down that opens when you click â–¶.
+ `Name` - by default operations are assigned a name that reflects the order they are added. You can personalise this here.
+ `Ramp Plunge` - Normally a deep cut is started by plunging the tool down into the work - by drilling a hole. Some tools or materials are not suitable for this, so a different approach is required. A ramp plunge is where the tool moves along the tool path while it also descends into the work. See <a href="https://www.harveyperformance.com/in-the-loupe/ramping-success/">here</a> for an excellent explanation.
+ `Combine` - specifies the boolean operation to apply to the selected paths. Draw a polygon with holes in it and view the results of the different operations in the simulator to understand how this works.
+ `Direction` - see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_cutter">Wikipedia</a> for the pros and cons of climb versus conventional milling.
+ `Margin` - this allows you to add a bit of extra space between the geometry and the tool path. You might need this for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milling_cutter">roughing</a> pass.
+ `Width` - some operations can cut a path wider than the tool diameter.
+ `Spacing` - specific to the `Perforate` operation, this is used to set the spacing between drill holes.
Not all options are appropriate for all operations; the drop-down will
change when you change the selected operation, and so will the tool
paths shown in the display.

## Curve Conversion

Bezier curves in paths are supported by converting them to a sequence
of straight line segments. This pane give you some options for
controlling this conversion.

## Gcode Generation

In the `Gcode Generation` pane, select the units that your machine
operates in. If your machine supports the `G21` code you can just use
the units you are most comfortable in.

When you draw in an SVG editor such as Inkscape, you work in a
coordinate system where 0, 0 is at the top left of the page, and Y
increases downwards. However hobbyist CNC machine coordinates usually
work from an origin at the bottom left, with Y increasing away from
the operator, and this is the convention that SVGcut follows.

The application handles most of the details of converting between
these coordinate systems. However it helps if you have a clear idea of
how the different systems relate.

+ SVG Coordinates - 0,0 is at the top left of the page. Y increases downwards.
+ The Machine Origin - 0,0 is the bottom left corner of the work area. All CNC machines have a coordinate origin, normally determined automatically by running each axis against the end stops.

You can choose for the machine origin to correspond to the bottom left
of the SVG page, or to the bottom left of the bounding box around your
selected operations. For example, let's say we want to carve the
Sanskrit word "Love". We have drawn it on a 80x60mm page, using Inkscape. The top left
corner of the bounding box of the drawing is at (10,15)mm while the
bottom right corner is at (70,45)mm, as shown by the green lettering.

<img src="/images/coords.svg" style="width:50%;height: auto"></img>

When we load up SVGcut and generate Gcode for this drawing with the
`Origin` set to `SVG Page`, then the lower left corner of the SVG page
becomes machine (0,0) and the lower left corner of the bounding box
will be at machine (10,15), as shown by the orange letters.

If we now switch the origin to `Bounding Box`, then the lower left
corner of the bounding box becomes machine (0,0), and the top right is
(60,30), as shown by the magenta letters.

If the origin is set to `Centre` then the centre of the bounding box
will be machine (0,0) while the bottom left corner will be at
(-30,-15).

As well as the "SVG page", "Bounding box", and "Centre", origins, you
can also add an additional offset to the origin. For
example, if you want to move the machine origin several times and
repeat the same cut.

## Previewing the Gcode

### Simulator

At any point you can preview th Gcode in the `Simulate` pane. This
really is a Gcode simulator; it reloads the generated Gcode, and
displays the paths the tool will follow. Previewing is a good idea, as
it can help you pick up on cases where the tool diameter is too great
to cut an acute angle.

### Code preview

You can also use the `View Gcode` button in the `Gcode Generation`
pane to open
a text view on the Gcode.

## Saving the Gcode

Once you are happy with the Gcode, save it to a file using `Save Gcode` from
the `File` menu. You can call it what you want, though if you use the
extension `.nc` it will be easier to find in Candle.

# Projects

The `File` menu lets you save and reload projects. You can save in
a file, or in the browser.

Note that your original SVG files are *not* saved with projects.
Despite that, projects can still be quite big, and the browser has
limited storage space, so keep the browser for templates and store
project files to disc.

## Templates
When you start up the app for the first time, it starts up with a
number of defaults, many of which you will probably change to suit
your own machine. You can save your new defaults for use in other
projects by selecting `Template only` when you save your project. If
you save a template called `defaults` in the browser, it will
automatically be loaded whenever you start up. You might have a number
of different tool configurations; you can save them the same way,
giving them meaningful names.

# Holding Tabs

To use
[holding tabs](https://www.axyz.com/technical-tip-of-the-week-when-to-use-holding-tabs/)
you have to draw paths in your SVG where you want the tabs to be. In
SVGcut, select these paths and use `Create Tabs` on the Tabs pane to
specify them as tabs. When the cutter passes over these areas, it will
be limited to cutting to the depth you specify.

# Relationship to `jscut`

SVGcut is a fork of
[Tim Fleming's `jscut`](https://github.com/tbfleming/jscut).
Development of `jscut` stopped some years ago, leaving a number
of pull requests and issues unaddressed. SVGcut has fixes for some of
these, and more.
+ Support for saving and loading projects
+ Open paths (polylines) as well as closed (polygons)
+ Select all paths on a double-click
+ Zoom and pan on paths
+ Easier to work with XY origins
+ Perforate operation
+ Raster pocket operation
+ Drill operation (for PCBs)
+ Per-operation spindle speed control
+ Gcode text preview
+ Extensive newbie documentation

Some features of `jscut` have been disabled/removed. This may be because
they are deemed too esoteric, or the (undocumented) code was too
complex to reverse engineer, for limited end-user value.
+ `V Pocket` operation. V cutting is a complex process with many variables, and there are many more powerful tools out there that can handle it.
